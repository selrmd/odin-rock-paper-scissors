My solution for: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS.<br>

# What I've learned v.01:
* Tried my best to break my code into multiple functions.<br>
* Not to use global variables.<br>
* Use every concept I've learned so far.<br>

# What I've learned v.02:
* Tried to style it with less css rules as possible to keep it simple and readable.<br>
* Optimized my code as much as possible and made it more modular.<br>
